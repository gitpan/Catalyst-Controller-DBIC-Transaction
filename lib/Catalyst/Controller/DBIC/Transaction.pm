=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Controller::DBIC::Transaction - Encloses actions into transactions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use base qw(Catalyst::Controller::DBIC::Transaction);
  sub foo :DBICTransaction('DB::Schema') {
     do $something or die $!;
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module enables the use of automatic transaction support into
Catalyst Actions, it will associate a given action with the
appropriate action class and save the DBIx::Class::Schema class name
for later use.

The action will be executed inside a txn_do, and a die inside that
method will cause the transaction to be rolled back, as documented in
DBIx::Class::Schema.

This method will not, on the other hand, handle that exception, since
txn_do will rethrow it. This means that this handling is not much
intrusive in the action processing flow.

NAME
    Catalyst::Controller::DBIC::Transaction - Encloses actions into
    transactions

SYNOPSIS
      use base qw(Catalyst::Controller::DBIC::Transaction);
      sub foo :DBICTransaction('DB::Schema') {
         do $something or die $!;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module enables the use of automatic transaction support into
    Catalyst Actions, it will associate a given action with the appropriate
    action class and save the DBIx::Class::Schema class name for later use.

    The action will be executed inside a txn_do, and a die inside that
    method will cause the transaction to be rolled back, as documented in
    DBIx::Class::Schema.

    This method will not, on the other hand, handle that exception, since
    txn_do will rethrow it. This means that this handling is not much
    intrusive in the action processing flow.
